#Summary of the code for processing HSI data with capsule network

The code failed to classify the HSI patches because it didn't converge.

- What does each file do
   - caps_model.py includes the model we use.
   - caps_train.py loads the data and defines how the model should be trained.
   - HSI_Data_Preparation.py reads the original .mat data and processes it to patches with specific size. 
   - nidaye.py prepare_data.py seeData.py are some
